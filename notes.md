# Notes


## GIT
- git add - puts the code in staging 
- git commit - takes "screenshot"  of the code, but pretty much just saves the changes that have occured between commits 
- git push - pushes the code (or saves the code) to github 
- git pull - adds the code from github to your local environment, kind of an update 
- git merge - creates new commit that includes a summary of the commits from the other line 
- git rebase - it takes all the commits that you did on the other line and applies it to the main line 

## Terminal 
- cat - Output file
- less - Interactive file output
- wc - Word count
- ps - view process
- kill - kill a process
- sudo - execute as admin 
- ssh - remote shell 
- scp - securely copy files to a remote computer
- history - show history of commands
- ping - test connection 
- tracert - trace network 
- dig - DNS information (what records you have registered for your DNS)
- man - look in the manual 

printf "hello world" > test.txt (prints to a newly created txt file)

## VIM
- j - down
- k - up
- h - left
- l - right

While usually you are using keystrokes like chords (the combination pressed together illicits a response) vim is melodic, meaning the pattern you press matters
