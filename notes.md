git add - puts the code in staging 
git commit - takes "screenshot" of the code, but pretty much just saves the changes that have occured between commits 
git push - pushes the code (or saves the code) to github 
git pull - adds the code from github to your local environment, kind of an update 
git merge - creates new commit that includes a summary of the commits from the other line 
git rebase - it takes all the commits that you did on the other line and applies it to the main line
